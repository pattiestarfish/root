SQLite is database engine, software allowing users to interact with relational database
- within SQLite, database stored as single file (distinguishing trait), allowing for greater accessibility than before (ie. can email single file)
- however, single file portability limits write permisions (only 1 user may edit at a time)
- SQLite does not offer data validation: allows entry of any data type (does not enforce user-defined schemas)

*access via git bash command: sqlite3 newdb.sqlite
